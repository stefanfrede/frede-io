Hello, I'm Stefan. I'm a freelance front-end developer from Germany based in
Hamburg.

As an advocate for a free internet which everyone should be able to use
everywhere and without restrictions, I try to reduce the complexity of modern
"best practices".

My focus is on HTML, CSS, progressive enhancement and accessibility. When I use
JavaScript, I like to limit myself to browser APIs whenever possible. The web
has come a long way. Features that used to require libraries or frameworks can
now easily be implemented using native JavaScript. Such an approach keeps the
codebase small, avoids bugs, and greatly improves performance.

Since 2004 I have been working as a full-time freelancer.
