I'm a front-end developer with a focus on HTML, CSS, Accessibility and
Progressive Enhancement and I like to limit myself to browser APIs whenever
possible.

The web has come a long way. Features that used to require libraries or
frameworks can now easily be implemented using vanilla JavaScript.

### Skills and experience include:

+ HTML and (S)CSS
+ Responsive Web Design
+ Accessibility and Progressive Enhancement
+ Vanilla JavaScript
+ Web Components, LitElement, and Vue.js
+ Jest, Mocha, and Chai
+ Redux and Redux-Saga
+ Webpack, Git, and Continuous Integration
+ Docker
