Hi. I’m Stefan, a front-end developer from Germany.

My focus is on HTML, CSS, Accessibility and Progressive Enhancement.  
When I use JavaScript, I like to limit myself to browser APIs whenever possible.

The web has come a long way. Features that used to require libraries or
frameworks can now easily be implemented using vanilla JavaScript.

Such an approach keeps the codebase small, avoids bugs, and improves the
performance.

I use the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) to build websites, because it
provides better performance, higher security as well as easier and cheaper
scaling.

Since 2004 I have been working in this business.
